## Hello everybody ðŸŽ‰
This space was created as a binder for several dedicated unofficial repos for "git and github tricks".<br>
Everything you see is legacy, unofficial material built for business purposes

- <b>How to:</b> Browse all projects and discover every detail of them. It's all free ;)
- <b>Licence:</b> All licenses are present within each repository. We don't assume any responsibility for the material displayed.
- <b>Contribute:</b> No plans are currently open or ready to contribute ... however you can always send a message to a contributor.
